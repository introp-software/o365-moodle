When you log back in to your Moodle instance, you are presented with the all the plugin configuration options. Save the settings without configuring them for now, you will come back to them later.

For information on installing plugins in Moodle see [Installing plugins](Installing plugins "wikilink")

Configuration
-------------

After you have the code installed in your Moodle instance, you'll need to do a bit of setup before you can use the plugins.

### Enable the OpenID Connect Authentication Plugin

1.  Navigate to **Site Administration \> Plugins \> Authentication** and click **Manage authentication**
2.  Locate the OpenID Connect authentication plugin and click the eye icon to enable
3.  Click the Settings link for the plugin.
4.  Verify the Authorization and Token endpoints. These should be set by default but if not, set the endpoints to the following:
    1.  **Authorization Endpoint:** <https://login.windows.net/common/oauth2/authorize>
    2.  **Token Endpoint:** <https://login.windows.net/common/oauth2/token>

5.  Note the Redirect URI. This should be the URI of your Moodle instance followed by /auth/oidc. You will need to enter this value into Azure AD later, so note this value and put it aside.
    1.  For example, <https://www.example.com/auth/oidc/>
    2.  Notes:
        1.  This is a fixed value that is derived from your Moodle site's configured URL (wwwroot). You cannot change this value directly. If you need to change it for any of the following reasons, you must change your Moodle site's configured domain name ($CFG-\>wwwroot).
        2.  This URL must be a fully qualified domain name pointing to your Moodle instance.
        3.  If your Moodle installation is configured with an IP address pointing to your instance, you must change $CFG-\>wwwroot in your config.php to a fully-qualified domain name.
        4.  This domain name does not need to be publicly accessible (i.e. internet-wide), but does need to be accessible to users of your Moodle instance. So, for example, you can use a intranet-only domain name.

### Prepare your Office 365 account for single sign-on with your Moodle installation

You will need an Azure subscription. If you do not have one, you can create one by visiting [http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/ Microsoft Azure Sign Up](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/ Microsoft Azure Sign Up "wikilink")

To use Moodle with Office 365 for SSO, you must [configure Microsoft Azure](https://manage.windowsazure.com) to manage your Office 365 Microsoft Azure Active Directory:

1.  Create a new Active Directory.
2.  Select Use existing directory.

![Add directory dialog with creation options](images/AddDirectory1.png "fig:Add directory dialog with creation options")

3.  Select **I am ready to be signed out now** and click the check mark.

![Add directory dialog log out option](images/AddDirectory2.png "fig:Add directory dialog log out option")

4.  Sign in with your Office 365 subscription credentials.
5.  Click **Continue**.
6.  Log out and sign back in to your Azure account.

**Note**: During the setup, you are required to enter a credit card and phone number. If you do not setup virtual machines or use paid services on the subscription, and only use it to access the Azure Active Directory, you will not be charged for the subscription.

    3.  For example: <http://contoso.sharepoint.com/moodle>

Connecting users to Office 365
------------------------------

To use any Office 365 features, a Moodle user must be connected to an Office 365 user that has an active Office 365 subscription. There are two ways to connect a Moodle user to an Office 365 user.

### Migrate the user to using their Office 365 credentials to log in to Moodle.

With this method, the user will log in to Moodle using their Office 365 account credentials.

- Users who do not yet have a Moodle account can simply follow the normal OpenID Connect login process (see: [OpenID Connect Authentication Usage](#openid-connect-authentication-plugin). If a Moodle account is not found for a user logging in with OpenID Connect, an account will be created for them.
- You can migrate existing Moodle users to Azure AD login by following the steps below:
  1. Ensure the user you want to migrate has the "auth/oidc:manageconnection" capability. Regular users do not have this capability by default.
  2. Ensure the Microsoft block has been added to a page in Moodle (for example, the Moodle dashboard).
  3. Log in as the user to be migrated, visit a page that has the Microsoft block visible.
  4. Click the **Connect to Office 365** link in the Microsoft block.
  5. You will be brought to the **Office 365 / Moodle Control Panel**.
  6. Click the *'Office 365 Connection* link under **Office 365 Features**
  7. Click the "Start using Office 365 to log in to Moodle." link.
  8. You will be redirected to Office 365 to log in. Log in to the Office 365 account you'd like to link the Moodle user to.
    1.  **NOTE:** If you are already logged in to Office 365, you will not have to enter your credentials on the Office 365 login page - the account you are logged in to will be linked to the Moodle account. Ensure you are logged in to the correct account, use a private browser window, or log out of Office 365 first to show the Office 365 login screen.
  9. You will be redirected back to Moodle to the Office 365 / Moodle control panel. The **Connection status** box on the side of the page should indicate that you are connected to Office 365 and that you are using Office 365 to log in to Moodle. 
  10. The Moodle account will now use Office 365 to log in. **The previous Moodle login method will not work.**. 
  11. The Moodle user can now use any of the Office 365 features in Moodle.

### Link a Moodle user to an Office 365 user.

This will allow you to connect a user to Office 365, enable all Office 365 features with this user, but not have to change their Moodle login method.

1. Ensure the Microsoft block has been added to a page in Moodle (for example, the Moodle dashboard).
2. Log in as the user to be migrated, visit a page that has the Microsoft block visible.
3. Click the **Connect to Office 365** link in the Microsoft block.
4. You will be brought to the **Office 365 / Moodle Control Panel**.
5. Click the *Office 365 Connection* link under **Office 365 Features**
6. Click the link that says **Link your Moodle account to an Office 365 account.**
7. You will be redirected to Office 365 to log in. Log in to the Office 365 account you'd like to link the Moodle user to.
  1.  **NOTE:** If you are already logged in to Office 365, you will not have to enter your credentials on the Office 365 login page - the account you are logged in to will be linked to the Moodle account. Ensure you are logged in to the correct account, use a private browser window, or log out of Office 365 first to show the Office 365 login screen.
8. You will be redirected back to Moodle to the Office 365 / Moodle control panel. The **Connection status** box on the side of the page should indicate that you are connected to Office 365 and that you are linked to an Office 365 account.
9. The Moodle account is now linked to the Office 365 account and can use Office 365 features as that user.
10. The Moodle user's login method will not change, the user will log in to Moodle as they always have.
11. If the user experiences any problems using Office 365 features, it's possible the token generated during this initial linking process has expired. Return to the **Office 365 / Moodle Control Panel** and click the **Refresh Connection** link in the Connection Status box. This will generate a new token.
