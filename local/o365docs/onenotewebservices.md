  3. Ensure the "Enabled" setting is checked (check it if it is not), and click "Save changes".
4. Create a "webservices" role that allows users to use the REST webservice protocol.
  1. Go to the "Define roles" page: `Site administration > Users > Permissions > Define roles`
  2. Click "Add a new role"
  3. Choose "No role" for "Use role or archetype", click "Continue"
  4. Enter "rest_webservice_user" as the role short name, and "REST Webservice User" as the custom full name.

  5. Click "Save changes"

Making a webservice call
------------------------
Now that webservices are set up on your Moodle site, you can begin making webservice calls.

All webservice calls:
- are POST requests made to `[moodle]/webservice/rest/server.php`
- use URL encoded parameters in the body of the post request.
- require (at minimum) three parameters:
  - `wstoken` This is the token you created for the user in the "setup" section above.
  - `wsfunction` This is the name of the function you are calling.
  - `moodlewsrestformat` This is the format you expect the response in, we will use "json"

For example, a request to get a list of a teacher's courses:
```
POST http://example.com/webservice/rest/server.php
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

wstoken=309ada75ccb5518f368d103b3c1fb0cb&wsfunction=local_o365_get_teachercourses&moodlewsrestformat=json
```

        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
4. Get existing grades for the "OneNote Test Assignment" in PSYCH101.
  
  This uses the 'id' parameter from the assignment we want from the 'assignments' object returned in the above step as the sole item in the 'assignmentids' parameter.

  Request:
  ```
  POST https://example.com/webservice/rest/server.php
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  
  wstoken=309ada75ccb5518f368d103b3c1fb0cb&wsfunction=mod_assign_get_grades&moodlewsrestformat=json&assignmentids%5B%5D=1
  ```
  Response:
  ```
  {
    "assignments":[
      {
        "assignmentid":1,
        "grades":[
          {
            "id":3,
            "userid":175,
            "attemptnumber":0,
            "timecreated":1459661701,
            "timemodified":1459662202,
            "grader":3,
            "grade":"88.00000"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "warnings":[]
  }
  ```
  We can see here there is one grade present for this assignment, from user "John Smith" (ID 175 from step 2).
5. Create a new grade entry

  This request uses the assignment id found in step 3, the user id from step 2 and a the new grade to set.
  
  Request:
  ```
  POST https://example.com/webservice/rest/server.php
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  
  wstoken=309ada75ccb5518f368d103b3c1fb0cb&wsfunction=mod_assign_save_grade&moodlewsrestformat=json&assignmentid=1&userid=175&grade=78&attemptnumber=-1&addattempt=0&workflowstate=&applytoall=1&plugindata%5Bassignfeedbackcomments_editor%5D%5Btext%5D=&plugindata%5Bassignfeedbackcomments_editor%5D%5Bformat%5D=2&plugindata%5Bfiles_filemanager%5D=0
  ```
  
  This function should return null if it was successful. You can repeat step 4 to verify the grade was saved correctly.
  
6. Create a new OneNote assignment
 
  This will create a new assignment in a given course, with the OneNote assignment and feedback types enabled.

  Request:
  ```
  POST https://example.com/webservice/rest/server.php
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  
  wstoken=309ada75ccb5518f368d103b3c1fb0cb&wsfunction=local_o365_create_onenoteassignment&moodlewsrestformat=json&data%5Bname%5D=A+new+test+onenote+assignment&data%5Bcourse%5D=2
  ```
  Response:
  ```
  {
    "data":[
      {
        "course":2,
        "coursemodule":91,
        "name":"A new test onenote assignment",
        "intro":"",
        "section":1,
        "visible":0,
        "instance":49
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
  Note that the "assignment id" referenced above for use with the grade-related functions is the "instance" attribute returned here. The "coursemodule" attribute is used with the other OneNote assignment functions (along with the course id) to get, update, or delete the assignment.
